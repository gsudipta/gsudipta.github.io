    abstract = {In this paper, I develop a theoretical model of firm‑to‑firm trade where customer‑suppler linkages respond to trade shocks. Firms
connect domestically and abroad. New linkages formation depends on both trade costs and network forming costs. I show that under
symmetric equilibrium, trade liberalization can transform the network distribution, thus affecting the firm level and aggregate productivity in
the economy. The model suggests revised observable sufficient statistics to measure welfare gains in a range of quantitative trade models
with endogenous production networks. Calibrating the model to trade between the US and the rest of the world, I find additional margins of
welfare gains from reduced trade costs attributable to endogenously changing firm linkages. Moving to autarky from free trade equilibrium in
2014, I find endogenous network changes contribute to more than one‑third of the welfare loss.}

    abstract={ We use consistent industry accounts to document novel cross‑country patterns of the extent of labor outsourcing. First, we provide
stylized facts on the extent and the composition of labor outsourcing across countries and its relation to employment legislation. We find that
the extent of both low and high‑skill labor outsourcing varies significantly across countries, and the providers tend to be smaller in size in
countries with smaller labor outsourcing sectors. Moreover, stricter regulation of temporary employment contracts, less unionization, and
weaker protection of intellectual property (IP) are associated with a smaller labor outsourcing sector. Second, we build a model of industry
dynamics and calibrate it to the economies of Belgium and Greece. Calibration results to come soon.}

support for this prediction only for exporting plants. For non‑exporting plants, we find no relationship between size and productivity. We show
that this asymmetry between exporting and non‑exporting plants is accounted for by product‑level import tariffs. Higher tariffs reduce
exposure to market competition which breaks the link between size and productivity for non‑exporters. Our results illustrate the pitfalls of
industrial policies that protect domestic firms from foreign competition.}

    abstract = {This paper examines firm‑related sources of urban wage premiums. Specifically, we study the roles of (1) more productive firms
sorting to larger labor markets and (2) the degree of labor market concentration in driving spatial wage inequality. While previous studies have
acknowledged the significance of both factors, their interactions have not been quantified. Using the Sample of Integrated Labour Market
Biographies (SIAB) from the German Institute for Employment Research (IAB), we first document a series of stylized facts about the spatial
distribution of firms’ labor market power, wage policies, industry compositions, and firm sizes. Next, motivated by the stylized facts, we
develop a spatial general equilibrium model that integrates location choices of heterogeneous (discrete type) firms and oligopsonistic local
labor markets. In the model, we assume sequential entry of firms with high‑productivity type firms deciding where to enter first, followed by
low‑productivity types. Larger labor markets are endowed with more productive workers. Hence, firms face a trade‑off: while entering larger
labor markets can lead to higher output, it also results in increased competition for labor, thereby raising labor costs. The equilibrium spatial
distributions of firms and wages are determined by the relative strength of these opposing forces. Finally, we calibrate our model using two
administrative datasets from Germany—the employer‑employee sample and the establishment panel—to quantify the relative impact of firm
sorting and labor market concentration on spatial wage inequality and conduct policy counterfactual experiments.}

We review the balance sheets of 45 central banks from around the world to describe actual practices. The principal findings are: (a) the average capital-asset ratio of central banks globally (net of revaluation capital which is purely an accounting entry) is 6.56 percent while the number in emerging economies is 6.96 percent; and (b) our Value-at-Risk estimates for the RBI excluding exchange rate risk indicate that the current level of the core capital of the RBI as mandated by the Jalan committee may be too low. We also discuss the policy moral hazards associated with mandating RBI equity payouts to the government.},

  abstract={The period since the 1990s has seen an aggregate growth takeoff in India during which the rural agricultural sector has gradually ceded space in both employment and output share to non-agricultural sectors. How have agriculture-dependent rural workers and households fared during this episode relative to their urban counterparts? Using household-level survey data, we find that rural–urban education gaps have declined significantly between 1983 and 2012. Moreover, occupation choices in the two sectors have become more aligned with an expansion of non-farm occupations in rural India. Consumption gaps between rural and urban households also declined between 1983 and 2005 for the bottom 45th percentile of the distribution. The period since 2005 has, however, witnessed a rise in consumption gaps. Using state-leveldata, we show that per capita income levels and growth rates are positive correlates of rural–urban consumption gaps, while the education gap is a negative correlate.},
