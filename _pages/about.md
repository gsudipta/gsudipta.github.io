Welcome!

My name is Sudipta and I am a PhD Candidate in the Vancouver School of Economics, University of British Columbia. I am on the 2024/25 job market and expect to graduate in 2025.

I have extensive experience in both empirical and quantitative economic research. My research interests include Macroeconomics, International Trade, and Labor Economics, focusing on firm dynamics.

I will be available for interviews during the  CEEE, EJME, and  AEA/ASSA virtual meetings.
